# apicurio-resources
General purpose repository for storing resources useful/helpful to the various Apicurio projects.

Some typical resources you might find in this repository:

## Scripts
We have a number of shell scripts, docker compose scripts, etc that we individually use to help us
with our daily work.  These scripts can be shared here for the benefit of all.

## Docs
Sometimes we may have writeups, presentations, or one-off documents that we create which have not
yet been organized into the primary project documentation (or when sometimes it doesn't make sense
to include within primary documentation). We can share these documents here.
